# Gaussian-Blur-Project
This project is a Bachelor Studies Thesis project. It was done in a team of three people - my colleagues X and Y, each specialized in a different part of the project.

This project implements a hardware-software system for counting free parking spaces in a bird' s-eye photograph of a parking lot. The system uses different image-processing techniques. One of these techniques - the Gaussian Blur, is accelerated by being implemented in hardware on an FPGA board. 

The project consists of four parts:
1. System level design - The initial software algorithm is analyzed and divided into software and hardware components of the future finished system.
2. RTL system design - The hardware part of the system is designed using a Hardware Description Language, optimizations are made and the system is tested on a bare-metal app.
3. Functional verification - The functionality of the designed IP module is verified using UVM methodology.
4. Driver and application development - The software and hardware parts of the system are integrated and made suitable for use.

The RTL system design part of this project is showcased in this repository. It is also the part in which I specialized in.
